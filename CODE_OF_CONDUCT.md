# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
info@mohammadnasser.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies
may be posted separately.

Community leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the community's leadership.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report
it by emailing info@mohammadnasser.com. All reports will be kept confidential.
In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If
that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain
confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law
enforcement first. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is
appropriate, please include this in your report and we will make every effort
to contact the appropriate agency.

### What to Include in Your Report

* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
  were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible
* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g.
  a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link
* Any extra context you believe existed for the incident
* If you believe this incident is ongoing
* Any other information you believe we should have

### What Happens After You File a Report

You will receive an email from the info@mohammadnasser.com address acknowledging
receipt immediately. We promise to take action within 24 hours (and will aim for
much quicker than that) to contact you and/or the accused individual to find out
more about what happened. We may involve other community members to help resolve
the issue, or for additional perspectives.

We will take into account many factors when determining a response, including:

* The nature and severity of the behavior
* The impact on the victim and the community
* Whether the incident was an isolated event or part of a pattern
* Whether the person acknowledges the behavior and is responsive to changing it
* Whether the person has been involved in similar incidents in the past
* Whether the person holds a position of power or authority in the community

### Appealing

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision,
contact the info@mohammadnasser.com email with your appeal and the conduct
team will review the case.
