## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Product Recommendation System seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### üö® How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please DO NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via one of the following methods:

#### Method 1: Email (Recommended)
- **Email**: security@mohammadnasser.com
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Product Recommendation System - [Brief Description]`
- **Encryption**: PGP key available upon request

#### Method 2: GitHub Security Advisory
- Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/nasserhaji/product-recommendation/security) in this repository
- Click "Report a vulnerability"
- Fill out the security advisory form

#### Method 3: Private Issue
- Create a new issue with the `[SECURITY]` prefix
- Set the issue to private/confidential
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### üìã Information to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact**: What could an attacker do with this vulnerability?
4. **Environment**: WordPress version, WooCommerce version, PHP version, plugin version
5. **Proof of Concept**: If possible, provide a proof of concept
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue
7. **Timeline**: When you discovered the vulnerability
8. **Disclosure**: Your preferred disclosure timeline

### üîí Example Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Product Recommendation System - XSS in form input

Description:
I found a potential XSS vulnerability in the product recommendation form where user input is not properly sanitized.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page with the recommendation form
2. Enter <script>alert('XSS')</script> in any text field
3. Submit the form
4. The script executes in the response

Impact:
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in users' browsers.

Environment:
- WordPress: 6.4
- WooCommerce: 8.0
- PHP: 8.1
- Plugin Version: 1.0.0

Proof of Concept:
[Include code or screenshots if applicable]

Suggested Fix:
Use wp_kses_post() or esc_html() to sanitize user input before output.

Timeline:
Discovered: 2024-01-15
Reported: 2024-01-15

Disclosure:
I can wait for a fix to be released before public disclosure.
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Input Validation and Sanitization

The plugin implements comprehensive input validation and sanitization:

```php
// Input sanitization examples
$user_input = sanitize_text_field( $_POST['user_input'] );
$user_email = sanitize_email( $_POST['email'] );
$user_url = esc_url_raw( $_POST['website'] );
$user_content = wp_kses_post( $_POST['content'] );
```

### Output Escaping

All output is properly escaped to prevent XSS:

```php
// Output escaping examples
echo esc_html( $output );
echo esc_url( $url );
echo wp_kses_post( $html_content );
echo esc_attr( $attribute );
```

### Nonce Verification

All forms use WordPress nonces for CSRF protection:

```php
// Nonce verification
if ( ! wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['nonce'], 'action_name' ) ) {
    wp_die( 'Security check failed' );
}
```

### Capability Checks

User capabilities are verified before allowing actions:

```php
// Capability checks
if ( ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) ) {
    return;
}
```

### SQL Injection Prevention

All database queries use prepared statements:

```php
// Prepared statement example
$wpdb->prepare( "SELECT * FROM {$wpdb->prefix}table WHERE id = %d", $id );
```

### File Upload Security

File uploads are restricted and validated:

```php
// File upload validation
$allowed_types = array( 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif' );
$file_type = wp_check_filetype( $file_name, $allowed_types );
```
